# Juomapeli Androidille 

A simple party game for Android devices, for cases when you have forgot to bring a deck of cards with you.
All card rules are customizable, and the custom rules will be memorized even after closing the app. 

NOTE: This project was entirely written back in 2019-2020, and published later in 2023 with a few screenshots.
